            <h3>Our Company</h3>
            <p class="bio">
                It is our company's mission to make going back to school easier than ever before!  The Magic School Bus removes all the stress from back-to-school shopping with our curated 'survival kits.' We offer kits for all ages, from kindergarten to your favorite coding bootcamp!<br>
                <h3>The MSB Team</h3>
                 <p class="bio">The MSB Team's founding members Tamela, Harper, and Bri all met during their time as students in coding bootcamp. They all bonded over the fact that they were all human, and in turn, very needy. They also realized that other students in their class also had basic human needs. They decided right then and there that they would spend the rest of their lives creating a brand that would respond to this need all humans have. MSB.com creates an opportunity for family members and friends to be creative and to say  "I care about you," "I miss you," and "I am thinking about you."</p><br>
                 <h3>Our Formula</h3>
                 <img id="formula" src="images//formula-for-care.png" alt="formula">
                 <p class="bio">Quality products for each care package are carefully chosen here at MSB.com. We have tailored each package to meet unique needs for each category through an algorithm based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. For example, the coding bootcamp package includes a travel coffee mug, a critical time in one's life to have access to caffeine any and all times.</p>
